The microservice will return all the addresses grouped by city 
so in the response you will receive an object city containing the Name of the citie and the different addresses.

You should try to reach an URL similar to the following one: https://localhost:44363/Home/GroupByCity once the app has be launched.

You will find the test in the UnitTestRiskFirst repository.
